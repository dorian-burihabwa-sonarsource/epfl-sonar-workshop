# EPFL Sonar Workshop (October 2023)

This repository serves as the base project to implement custom rules for Java.
It is derived from the [base template of the sonar-java project](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-java/tree/1947bdb5bec965afcee43087febf32245cb06253/docs/java-custom-rules-example).

For more details about how to write custom rules, please refer to the official tutorial, [Writing Custom Java Rules 101](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-java/blob/1947bdb5bec965afcee43087febf32245cb06253/docs/CUSTOM_RULES_101.md).
